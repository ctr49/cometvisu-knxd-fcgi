# fcgi-curl.sh — Send HTTP-style requests to the cometvisu-knxd-fcgi backend
#                via FastCGI, using cgi-fcgi as the protocol bridge.
#
# Usage:
#   ./tools/fcgi-curl.sh GET  '/r?a=KNX:1/2/3&t=30'
#   ./tools/fcgi-curl.sh POST '/w' 'knx=10/20&data=0c6f&type=write'
#   ./tools/fcgi-curl.sh POST '/l' 'user=admin&pass=secret'
#
# Environment variables:
#   FCGI_PORT   TCP port the backend listens on (default: 9000)
#   FCGI_HOST   Host where the backend runs     (default: 127.0.0.1)
#
# Examples (once the backend is running via "Run against real knxd"):
#
#   # Login (creates a session)
#   ./tools/fcgi-curl.sh POST '/l' 'user=admin&pass=admin'
#
#   # Read an address from knxd cache
#   ./tools/fcgi-curl.sh GET '/r?a=KNX:1/2/3&t=5'
#
#   # Write a value
#   ./tools/fcgi-curl.sh POST '/w' 'knx=10/20&data=0c6f&type=write'
#
#   # Read with long-poll (waits up to 30 seconds for a telegram)
#   ./tools/fcgi-curl.sh GET '/r?a=KNX:1/2/3&t=30'
